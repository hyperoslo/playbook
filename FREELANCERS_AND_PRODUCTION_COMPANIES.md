# Freelancers and productions companies

As a freelancer or production company for Hyper we expect you to follow our guidelines for
production. Underneath you’ll find and overview of how we work and what we expect from you.

  We hold your opinion in high regard and want to here what you have to bring to the table. But to
make our work the most effective, especially down the line, we have a set of guidelines.  

## Day to day workflow 

### Design

All our work involve working closely with the whole team at Hyper. But for technology the closest
ties are to the designers. Their experience with both visual and interaction design paired with
your knowledge about technology is our edge in developing apps.

They use [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to deliver the designs. This way we don't have to dig trough
Sketch or Photoshop file to get the correct font-size. Zeplin can be opened in the app on Mac or on
the web.

### Code

*Regarding code*, we would like to invite you to work in our GitHub. There you’ll get access to the
repos you need. We will have a internal developer helping you get access and providing access to
other services you need. 

We would like you to follow our style guides and best practice.

- [Git and GitHub](https://github.com/hyperoslo/playbook/blob/master/GIT_AND_GITHUB.md)
- [Workflow](https://github.com/hyperoslo/playbook/blob/master/WORKFLOW.md)
- [Code styles](https://github.com/hyperoslo/playbook/blob/master/CODE_STYLE.md)

Make sure you read up on this before starting a project. If you have any input or questions be sure
to ask, we are here to help and love to discuss code. 

When working we would prefer pull requests with well written commits and documented work. This way
we can follow along and make sure we understand what is being done and make it easier for us to
maintain. 

## Documentation

Think about your readme as your apps resume or CV, it should give a great overview of what it
contains and how it works. The readme should be structured and easy to navigate. 

The readme should consist of tree parts: 
1. How to run the app and where to find it. It should be easy to understand how to set up the app
from the documentation in the readme. It should also be easy to figure out where the app is hosted,
where to access, staging and production and where the admin is located and how that works. 
2. Give and overview of the functionality. If your app consists of some special functionality,
contact with third party APIs or any other elements that are not immediately clear make sure to
especially document them. 
3. Links and documentation of any third party services. Especially if they are not regular Hyper
services.

## Credentials and third party apps

### Third party apps

Be sure to register all third party apps to a Hyper account. Ask the Hyper developer responsible for
your project to help if you need to. This is to make sure we don't have to chase you down after the
project to get access to parts of the project.

 This includes things like; Facebook apps, API keys, third party accounts, hosting or helper
services, and so on.

### Credentials

 Be sure to make strong passwords for any admin or outwards facing infrastructure. No usernames and
passwords should ever be stored in the GitHub repo.  We use ENV variables from
[Heroku](https://heroku.com) to handle this.

## General workflow 

### Slack

We will invite you to our Slack where you’ll get access to projects channels to communicate with
your team and potentially the client. 

### Onsite and remote

We would like you to visit our office at least two times a week and preferably more. This way you
can have the closest work with the rest of the team.

If you choose to work remotely you are free to do so, just let your team know when and where you are
and what you are working with. Communication is key when working remote and its important to be
overly clear in your communication.  Read up on our
[remote guidelines](https://github.com/hyperoslo/playbook/blob/master/WORKING_REMOTE.md).

### Rest of the team

Besides the designers and developers you’ll work with project managers, creatives and advisors. We
are all part of a big team and are here to help each other deliver the best possible product. Both
good and bad news should be shared in your team to make the ride as smooth as possible.
