# Working remotely

## Why?

For the last 200,000 years, our only option for working together has been
being together. You could say we're used to it.

But the rules are changing; where we were previously limited by the reach of
our voice, we can now synthesize it into radio signals that can carry it
to Mars.

It's probably not a good idea to work from Mars, though; it'd take anything
you say between 4 and 24 minutes to reach someone on Earth depending on our
relative orbits around the Sun, and you'd probably die.

It'd be pretty great to work from anywhere on Earth, however! For one thing we
could draw upon the more than seven billion people in the world rather than
just the few hundred thousand in Oslo to build great things with us, and for
another we'd all have the opportunity to see the world while doing it.

Changing the way that people have been doing things for 200,000 years isn't
something we can do overnight, but we hope to change it in five. When you can
stream yourself in 1080p from the top of Mount Everest and holograms are
commonplace, we want to be great at it while the rest scramble to catch up.

## How?

Working remotely can be challenging because it requires new and different tools,
and because some of those tools are still pretty new. A tap on the shoulder is
a message on Slack, a meeting is a Google Hangout and looking over someeone's
shoulder is a Trello board.

It will take time to change the way we work together, and we'll have problems on
the way. But that's okay; if we don't have problems, we can't fix them.

Let's share the problems we've had and how we fixed them here so we'll only
have to do it once.

#### Share where you are

We're used to seeing each other at the office, and so it's easy to liken
someone not being in their seat to them being unavailable. So if you're in a
different place than usual, make sure everyone knows!

If you're usually at the office but you're working from home today, let your
team know so they don't go looking for you.

If you're usually in New York but travelled to Beijing on a whim, let your team
know so they know you're on a different schedule. And because that's awesome.

#### Be available

When you're remote, you should be as available as you are when you're at the
office. Hell, you should be more available. And you can! Hang out in a video
call where people can reach you. It'll be as if you're *next to everyone in
the office at the same time*. Whoa, technology!

#### Be good at meetings

It can be tough to meet with people who are remote without good tools. So we
made really good tools. We hooked up every room with a TV to Google Hangouts,
and anyone can join them from [rooms.hyper.no](http://rooms.hyper.no).

No need to rely on someone to call you if you're remote, then; just join the
meeting yourself!

And once you're there, don't mute your microphone or turn off your camera; that
makes it harder for you to participate, and it could even seem that you don't
even want to.
