# Taxes

So it's awesome to make money doing stuff you love, however some people are
not so lucky. That is basically why we pay so much tax in Norway,
to help others that are not as fortunate as your self.

However we also get allot back from those taxes as well. For example
free health care, free education, financial security, etc. and thus
a more stable society to live in. Since, you know, you won't loose your
house and live on the street by the first sign of trouble. Yay!

## Different types of taxes

### Regular tax

Varies between 11% and 47% based on you level of income. there are also
some deductions from this percentage based on your mortgage, number of
kids, type of work, etc.

[See a table of tax percentages based on yearly income here](http://www.smartepenger.no/skatt/103-skatt/653-skatteprosenter-pa-lonnsinntekt).
Sadly this is only available in Norwegian, but google
translate might help you understand it. The first table is without
mortgage loan and the second is with an estimated mortgage of 2 times
your income (a modest loan if you live in Oslo).

Regular taxes are held back and paid in by your employer and is part of
an automatic process strictly regulated by Norwegian accounting principles.

### Payroll tax

**Applies to**: The Employer

**Percentage**: Between 14.1% and 0%. 14.1% for Hyper since our
employees are based in Oslo.

Why should employers have to pay the government to hire you? Basically
this works like an insurance for you as an employee. If you are fired
and cannot find another job in Norway you will still receive a salary for
up to 2 years (minumum of 1 year). The salary is based on your income
the last 3 years and is less a bit less than what you usually would
earn working.

There are more reasons for employers paying Payroll tax but i will not
go into them here.

#### Reduced tax in December and Juli

The Norwegian tax system is based upon 10.5 months of tax. This does
not mean that you pay less tax. It means that you pay a greater
portion of your taxes 10 10 months of the year.

The result is that your salary in July is without taxes and you only pay
50% of the usual tax in December. Oh joy! For once, strange bureaucratic
rules come in handy :)

#### Tax reduction for foreigners

(I don't know much about this. Can some one else explain this?)

Basically the first 2 years when of working in Norway you get a tax
reduction to help you get settled in (and get used to the high level of
taxes here). Welcome to Norway! :)

### Vacation money (Feriepenger)

**Applies to**: Full time employees

**Percentage**: minimum 10.2 % or more. or 12.5% for employees
of age 60 or above.

#### The good part

So first of all, this is not a tax. It is accounting law. Vacation money
is a sum of money saved on your behalf by your employer to ensure that you
have a salary that equals your average monthly income during vacation.

This is good because we have so many vacation days in Norway (yay!).
A minimum of 4 week (counted as 4 * 5 workdays, so 20 work days in total).
**At Hyper we are even luckier and have 5 vacation weeks.**

Out of 120.000 kr. we get 107.760 kr. ( 120k * (1 - 0.102) ) paid
out directly thought the hours we work. The rest is saved for us by
the employer and given to us to be used while we are not working
(on vacation). This is usually set to a fixed month, like every June
the following year.

So this law ensures that you are paid at least an average monthly income
even though you take vacation during the year.

Exactly how and when this money is paid out is solved differently
by employers. Ask Ragnhild for more details on how we do this at Hyper.

#### The bad part

Since vacation money is paid out the following year you basically
receive none during your first year for the first full time job in Norway.
If you switch to another Norwegian employer you will receive your vacation
money from your last employer the first year.

### VAT (MVA or moms in norwegian)

So this is the annoying tax that applies to most goods and services that
you buy here in Norway. Its a whopping 25% for most things. Most
countries have this tax so not much need to explain this i guess.

Transportation only have 8% VAT. Entertainment like theatre
performances, books and magazines pays no VAT under certain circumstances.
There are more exceptions to the 25% rule as well.

## Damn taxes!

*Or, why can't Norway just spend it's oil money already!*

Well... this is why: [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_budgetary_rule](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_budgetary_rule)

Also, it would just trash the Norwegian economy in so many ways,
because economics...
