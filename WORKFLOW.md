# Workflow

It's hard to make great products. It's hard because there are a million choices
along the way, and because it never really ends. In a word, it's uncertain.

There are two ways to deal with that; to control it, or to accept it.

The natural thing to do is to control it, and it works really well if you can
predict the future. Otherwise it is futile, and you should not try.

The other way is to accept that it is uncertain and deal with it. That is to
accept that things will change along the way, and to make it as painless as
possible when they do.

That's called "agile", and that's what we choose to do.

## Agile

> _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
> _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
> _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
> _Responding to change_ over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
> on the left more.

Our products vary in complexity and duration and so our workflow varies equally,
but there are some things that we always do:

### Stories

We keep things simple so everyone can contribute, and that starts with
explaining things simply. When we decide what we're building, we describe it in
short stories that explain _who_, _what_ and _why_.

Good:

* As a _visitor_, I want to _log in with Facebook_ so that _people can see who
  I am_.

Bad:

* Implement Facebook Connect with the JavaScript SDK.

### Backlog

We keep a list of the stories that we should do, and we call it the _backlog_.

### Sprints

Every week, we select the most important stories from the backlog to work on. We
call that a _sprint_.

#### Sprint planning

At the beginning of each week, we get together to plan a new sprint. At the end
of the meeting, the team should have committed to a week's worth of user stories
to complete.

We like to timebox sprint plannings to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What are we doing next week?

#### Sprint review

At the end of each week, we get together to review the sprint that we had and
that the stories in it are in fact complete. At the end of the meeting, the
stories that were completed are deployed, and the ones that aren't go back at
the top of the backlog.

We like to timebox sprint reviews to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What did we do last week?

#### Sprint retrospective

At the end of each week, we get together to talk about how we worked. This is
where we get better.

We like to timebox sprint retrospectives to 15 minutes with the following
agenda:

* What should we start doing?
* What should we stop doing?
* What should we continue doing?

### Stand-up

Every day, the team should tell each other what they're doing. We call that a
_stand-up_.

We like to timebox stand-ups to 10 minutes where everyone takes turns asking
these questions of themselves:

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I be doing today?
* Are there any impediments in my way?
