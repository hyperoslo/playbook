# You got hired!

First things first; congratulations! You must be pretty awesome!

## Thanks! What's next?

Well, that depends.

### I'm already a viking

Just drop by the office, sign the contract and hang out! Then all that's left to do
is count the days. All three months of them.

### I'm becoming a viking

That's great! Now for the bad news. Imagine a rain forest. Now imagine cutting down all the trees
in that rain forest and churning them into paper. That's all the forms we have to fill and letters
we have to send to get you here. But it's okay! We'll get through it! In fact we have sort of a lot
of experience with hiring awesome people.

#### How do I get there?

Whoa there cowboy! If you're from a country outside the EU/EEA, you can't just get on a flight
willy-nilly! You have to apply for a permit first, and that permit is called a [residence permit for skilled workers](http://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/). We'll work on this together.

If you're in the EU/EEA, though, you could catch the next flight and start tomorrow! All you have to do
is hook up with the police to tell them that you're here, and as long as you do that within three months
of coming here they're totally cool with it.

Whichever the case, when the time comes you'll want to get a flight to Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL)
and catch a train into town. There's two: [The Airport Express](http://www.flytoget.no/eng/)
(“Flytoget” in Norwegian) or the regular train. The Airport Express is slightly faster and slightly more
expensive. Either way you should get off at [Oslo Sentralstasjon](https://www.google.no/maps/place/Oslo+Sentralstasjon/@59.911032,10.752408,17z).

Just let us know when you board the train and we'll meet you there!

#### Where am I going to live?

Traditionally vikings have preferred to live in caves and huts, but currently the preferred places to
inhabit are apartments.

We'll put out an ad to rent a nice apartment near the office ahead of time and compile a list of options
for you, then when you're here you can pick the ones you like and we'll go see them together. In the meantime,
your stay is on us; there will be a room waiting for you at a nice hotel right by the office.

Once we find an apartment, we'll cover the security deposit. We can also arrange to pay the rent out of your
paycheck, since you might not have a bank account of your own just yet.

You can't wait to come so you want to start looking for some apartments? Let's do that then, here you'll find two great websites to look for your next home: [Finn](http://www.finn.no/finn/realestate/lettings/result?areaId=20061) and [Hybel](http://hybel.no/bolig-til-leie/annonser/oslo) once you have some you like, send us the links and we are going to talk with the landlord to arrange a visit as soon as you get here.
