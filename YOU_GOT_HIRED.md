# You got hired!

First things first; congratulations! You must be pretty awesome!

## Thanks! What's next?

Well, that depends.

### I'm already a viking

Just drop by the office, sign the contract and hang out! Then all that's left
to do is count the days. All three months of them.

### I'm becoming a viking

That's great! Depending on where you're from, that ranges from the easiest
thing in the world to a forest worth of paperwork.

#### I'm from a country in the Schengen zone

Hurray! You're on the "easiest thing in the world" end of the scale. In fact
you could just get on a plane and start working tomorrow. All you have to do
is hook up with the police to tell them that you're here, and as long as you
do that within the first three months they're totally cool with it.

#### I'm from a country outside the Schengen zone

Okay, so it's going to take a bit of work to get you here. Don't worry, though;
we have a lot of experience with hiring awesome people, and we'll apply for your
permit together.

## I'm in Norway! Now what?

You'll want to get a flight to Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL) and catch a train
into town. There's two: The Airport Express ("Flytoget" in Norwegian) or the
regular train. The Airport Express is slightly faster and slightly more expensive.
Either way you should get off at [Oslo Sentralstasjon](https://www.google.no/maps/place/Oslo+Sentralstasjon/@59.911032,10.752408,17z).

Just let us know when you board the train and we'll meet you there for a
proper hello!

### Where am I going to live?

Traditionally vikings have preferred to live in caves and huts, but currently the preferred places to
inhabit are houses.

We'll put out an ad to rent a nice apartment near the office ahead of time and compile a list
of options for you, then when you're here you can pick the ones you like and we'll go see
them together. In the meantime, your stay is on us.

Once we find an apartment, we'll cover the security deposit. We can also arrange to pay the
rent out of your paycheck, since you might not have a bank account of your own just yet.

### Where do I put my money?

Not only do we get to have fun and build great things, but people are also
giving us money for doing it! You'll want a place to put yours. Like your
mattress. But preferably a bank account.

To get an account with a Norwegian bank, you'll need a national ID number.
To get that, you'll need to register with the Norwegian tax authority. It
sounds complicated, but really it's pretty straightforward; we'll schedule
an appointment with them together and bring your passport and employment
contract. If you're from a country outside of the Schengen zone and had
to apply for a residence permit, we'll bring that, too.

You'll get your national ID number a few weeks later. When you do, the bank
and you will be cool and they'll let you open an account with them. We'll
go see them together, too.
