# Tools

These are tools that we like. You don't have to use them, but you probably should.

## Label

We use [label](https://github.com/jgorset/label) to label the gems in our Gemfiles.

## Heroku

We use [heroku-deploy](https://github.com/hyperoslo/heroku-deploy) as the best way to send our latest version to Heroku.

## Direnv

We configure our Ruby on Rails applications with environment variables. A lot of environment variables. We use
[direnv](https://github.com/zimbatm/direnv/) to keep them in check.
